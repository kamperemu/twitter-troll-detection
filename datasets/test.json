Ohh no. Its out of our control.r && I guess the inhumane way of growing all our food supplies is something to overlook as well. Only being that the animals literally cant think move do anything ut produce giagantic chicken breasts and stand in their own poop their entire life till the stock yards.

Compassionate and caring and loves everything that I do. He enjoys all the same foods as I do and is open to exploring new boundaries he's never expierenced. Ohh and He let's me be crazy about things that Im so passionate about that most guys would laugh at and make fun of. Recycling planting flowers and smiling at people just because I want to make their day! :] He's perfect for me. He understands me in every aspect a man could. Hes sweet enough to damper my attitude and sarcasm at times but bullheaded enough to not always give in to me. Lets me whine if I want attention and holds me more than I could ever want to be held. I love him. And for me hes my perfet guy! <3r Ohh and he's a super sexxy stud :] of course."

## Abstract
In the present age of social media websites, trolls are inevitable. Trolls are people or bots who spread misinformation on social media
to push their political agenda. These trolls use fake accounts to stay anonymous and influence public opinion. 
There is a problem with manual detection of trolls - humans too find it difficult to detect trolls and it isn't possible for humans to 
check millions of messages that are uploaded everyday. Therefore, using AI to detect such trolls is much easier and efficient.
Different models like SVM, neural networks, logistic regression can be used. These can also be used with pre-trained Natural Language Processing(NLP) models
and combine it with the former models. These models are used to find out whether or not the message content is a troll or not by discovering patterns in these tweets We can then choose the most accurate model for direct implementation.
